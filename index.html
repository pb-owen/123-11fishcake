  <p> A software that I personally use is Agent Desktop (ADT). It is the client database I use for my job at work. I work for an insurance company and we deal with multiple large companies like Samsung, Google, Best Buy, etc. ADT is well designed because if you look up a client's information, 
      it will show you everything associated with that individual across all companies for which they have a registered service or product. Not only does this database store information, but through it you can take payments for services, as well as dispatch claims for service; examples include
      sending a customer a replacement phone, or organizing for a service company to come and fix their furnace, etc. Software Design is important because it allows for simple understanding of wants and needs from a product. ADT is simple, easy to navigate and is very useful to us as insurance 
      representatives because we can improve productivity by not having to switch between different services for each type or request we have to handle. Software Design is important for our clients as well, by having a simple system, we can improve customer experience. Instead of them waiting 
      on hold while I go between different softwares and processes to get their claim started, I can easily do it all in one place, reducing the amount of time that the client has to wait; and allows us to help more clients. </p>

  <p> During the requirement gathering stage, the specifications of a product are collected/documented to create a list of requirements for an ideal product. The requirement gathering stage is important because it sets the boundaries for the software being designed. This stage allows developers
      to collect user stories that include the simple, concise description of the software requirements from the user’s perspective. Having clear requirements make the process of designing and implementing very efficient as there will be little to no miscommunications for the group developing 
      the desired product.

      As a user I want to be able to search up a customer contract by phone number so that I can find all associated contracts registered to their phone number

      As a user I want to be able to search by incident number / claim request so that I can find the exact reference the customer is calling about

      As a user I want to able able to take payments in the system for service charges so that I can assure the customer’s account information is up to date

      As a user I want to be able to move different claims and notes to a specific queue so that there can be a priority of incidents that need to be actioned
    
      As a user I want to be able to change customer information that has been uploaded by vendors such as billing address, and contact information so that I can assure that we are contacting/delivering the right information to the account holder </p>

<h1> Writing Assignment 4 </h1>
<p> It is very important to have communication during the software development process. Some key elements of good communication include clarity, attentiveness,  and positive feedback. To begin, clarity is important in communication so that the point you are trying to get across to your team is 
    clearly understood; without needing to repeat yourself multiple times. Secondly, attentiveness is crucial for effective communication. If members are not being attentive, they may lose track of the points being discussed therefore not having a clear idea of the processes leading to the end 
    goal of the product. Lastly, constructive feedback is important because all ideas should be welcome, even if they are ideas that you do not agree with. By giving constructive feedback on a comment or idea, it keeps the members of the team motivated to keep sharing their ideas, instead of 
    if you shot their idea down and said that you weren’t a fan. An example I have experienced where I encountered issues in communication was in the paper prototyping lab, where during our first presentation of our product features, a group member and I had different ideas of how the functions 
    would work on our product. This caused us to make a mistake in the presentation. We regrouped and tried to communicate by referencing our design document to clarify the main focus of the concept being presented. We listened to each other’s interpretations of the product and collectively as 
    a team decided on what we wanted to present by slightly modifying the function through constructive feedback from the first presentation attempt. </p>
