  <h1> Writing Assignment 1 </h1>
  <p> A software that I personally use is Agent Desktop (ADT). It is the client database I use for my job at work. I work for an insurance company and we deal with multiple large companies like Samsung, Google, Best Buy, etc. ADT is well designed because if you look up a client's information, 
      it will show you everything associated with that individual across all companies for which they have a registered service or product. Not only does this database store information, but through it you can take payments for services, as well as dispatch claims for service; examples include
      sending a customer a replacement phone, or organizing for a service company to come and fix their furnace, etc. Software Design is important because it allows for simple understanding of wants and needs from a product. ADT is simple, easy to navigate and is very useful to us as insurance 
      representatives because we can improve productivity by not having to switch between different services for each type or request we have to handle. Software Design is important for our clients as well, by having a simple system, we can improve customer experience. Instead of them waiting 
      on hold while I go between different softwares and processes to get their claim started, I can easily do it all in one place, reducing the amount of time that the client has to wait; and allows us to help more clients. </p>
